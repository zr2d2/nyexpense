View NY Senate Expenses by Senator

# Introduction #
This project seeks to visualize expenses made by New York senators, using [open data](http://www.nysenate.gov/opendata).

# Details #

Using a Sparql query and a [sparql endpoint](http://logd.tw.rpi.edu/), this project retrieves expenditure data from New York Open Data, and displays it in a Google Visualization chart.  It then searches for relevant New York Times articles related to the Senator.  It also grabs the Senator's twitter feed (if they have one), or tweets from @NYSenate.
